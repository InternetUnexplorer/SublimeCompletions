Help: Generate Files

Extract your ComputerCraft.jar file using a tool such as WinRar or 7Zip. It does not matter where.

Next, set the Input Directory to PATH_TO_UNZIPPED_JAR/assets/computercraft/lua/rom/help
Set the output directory to whatever you want.

Click 'Start' to start! It's that simple!

Note: To edit the template used to generate the files, edit the /main/resources/template file in this jar.
